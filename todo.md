#Appointedd programming challenge
Coding challenge - Create a simple appointment booking system

Tech Specs:

- PHP MVC framework
- Data is to be stored in MongoDB (preferably using an ORM)
- Javascript (optional)

Database collections:

- customers (first name, last name)
- staff (first name, last name)
- services (name, duration) i.e. Sports Massage
- appointments (customer, staff, service, start time, end time, duration)

Solution:

- Create a web form to enter appointments into the database
- Customers, staff, services can be manually entered into the DB i.e. only appointments themselves need to be entered via the web form
- The web form should let the user select the customer, service, staff member and then enter the start date/time of the appointment

Bonus features:

- Not all staff members can perform all services
- Prevent double bookings
